## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Construction is a field of work that has created all the buildings and furnature that you see around you everyday.
* The technology for construction is progessing rapidly in this century. I will show you apps and hardware I have found that have been made for construction.
* I found 2 websites. One was called <a link href="https://www.dustyrobotics.com/articles/what-is-construction-technology"> Dusty Robotics </a> that had catagories of technology. It had robotics, 3D printing and drones. 2nd website was called <a link href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/tools/best-construction-project-management-software/"> DPM</a> that had websites that helped in construction. It had websites like <a link href="https://contractorforeman.com/?utm_source=crozdesk&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=list"> Contractor Foreman</a>, <a link href="https://monday.com/lp/project-management?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=dpm&utm_adgroup=best_construction_project_management_software&utm_campaign=ww-multi-prm-work_mgmt">monday.com</a> and <a link href="https://crewcost.com/?utm_campaign=25151856-Referral%20Sites&utm_source=The%20Digital%20Project%20Manager"> Crew Cost</a>.

  ### Construction Worker
  * **3D printing:**
  * decreases costs for materials
  * decreases building time
  * makes complex designs
  * makes parts for buildings or furnature
    ![3D Printer](what-is-3d-printing-thumb-1172x660.avif)
    
  * **Robotics:**
  * Robotics helps in demolition, laying materials, and excavation
  * because robotics does all those things, employee safety improves a lot
  * reduces manual labor
  * increases efficiency
  * lets construction workers focus on less physically demanding tasks

  ### Inspectors
  * **Drones:**
  * Drones inspect active and potential sites
  * Drones are safer for inspections bc if something were to happen to the drone you can make another one
  * More efficient bc they can look into more smaller spaces that a human cannot
