## Context
<p> In order to finalize my research on construction technology, I have organized my research. In this blog, I will show how I organized my information and more.</p>

## Content
<p> Since blog 2, I have realized there has been a problem with my research. It was hard to read my information. It was messy and not very organized. So, I decided to make it more neat. I thought of a way to seperate my research into catagories. I made 3 catagories. They were construction workers, contractors and inspectors. In these catagories, I put research from part A and B that corresponded with the catagory. In construction worker, I put 3D printing and robotics since 3D printing makes parts and robotics does physical labor. In contractors, I put drones since inspectors can use drones for potential sites. Finally, in contractors I put all the part A information since all of part A was mostly useful towards contractors. </p>

## EDP
<p> Currently, I am done with researching and brainstorming. I am now on the step of planning the most promising solution. To do this, I wil start looking at my research and maybe put it on a webpage.</p>

## Skills
Skills I've gotten better at and learned are communication, time management and organizing.

### Communication
<ul>
  <li> Throughout the whole research organizing part, I was very confused. I didn't know what catagories to make. That's when I learned to talk to others and through that I came up with ideas for the catagories.</li>
</ul>

### Time Management
<ul>
  <li> Throughout this whole process, I've been very busy. I have had many projects and tests. Especially this week when writing my blog. So, I have made a way so that more important assignments get done first while less grade-impacting assignements get done last.</li>
</ul>

### Organizing
<ul>
   <li> Before the research organization part, I didn't prioritize organization much. After this, I realized how imoortant organization is and how easy it is to process information when stuff is organized. </li>

## Next Steps
<p> My next steps are to create a plan for the most promising solution.</p>
  
</ul>
