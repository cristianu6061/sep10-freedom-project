# Entry 1: Deciding on the topic
##### 10.7.25
<h2>My Freedom Project Topic</h2>
<p>The topic I picked was construction. I picked this because some of my relatives work in construction. Also, I always liked watching videos about construction and just making buildings overall. I always wondered about the materials used in buildings, the strategies used to build, and  more. I thought about clothes, but I soon realized all my ideas were already made by other people and were popular. So, I thought that construction would be my best choice. I used these websites to help me learn more about this topic. <a href="https://www.dustyrobotics.com/articles/what-is-construction-technology">What is Construction Technology</a>. <a href="https://www.devicemagic.com/blog/6-types-of-construction-technology-you-will-use-in-the-future/">6 Types of Construction Technology.</a> <a href="https://openasset.com/resources/construction-technology/">Construction Technology.</a></p>
<h2>Engineering Design Process</h2>
<p>I am in the first stage of edp. This step is to define my problem. I think the problem with construction technology is that people don't see the full potential of construction technology. My next step to <b>research my problem </b> and in order to do this, I will read more about construction technology through websites and collaberate with my peers so I can get extra assistance for researching my problem.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Skills that I've picked up on while doing this blog is <b>how to search, teamwork, and time management.</b></p>
<p><b>How to Search</b></p>
<p>When I was researching construction technology, I saw many websites and was confused on what to press. I realized that the descriptions gave good details about what the article was about. So using that, I found good websites to search through in no time.</p>

<p><b>Teamwork</b></p>

<p>Even with the articles, I was still left with some questions about the technology. So, with the help of my friends, I soon got answers and learned way more about construction tech. </p>

<p><b>Time Management</b></p>

<p>This week was really busy. This week, I had a family member sleep at my house for a week so having to deal with that plus helping my mom way more really made my schedule kind of tight. So, I learned to break assignments up into parts so I can finish them all on time. This blog took especially a lot more time but I did end up finishing it at least.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>My next step is to research aboout the great technology of construction.</p>
