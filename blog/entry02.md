## Context
<p>In order to learn more about construction technology, I've researched lots on different construction software and hardware. In this blog I will be showing what I have found and what I have found most useful.</p>

## Content
<p> So far, since blog 1, I have found lots of technology regarding construction. I started off by searching "Construction apps". I found a website called  <a link href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/tools/best-construction-project-management-software/"> DPM</a> that led to many other websites. In there, I found 3 websites. I found <a link href="https://monday.com/lp/project-management?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=dpm&utm_adgroup=best_construction_project_management_software&utm_campaign=ww-multi-prm-work_mgmt">monday.com</a>, <a link href="https://contractorforeman.com/?utm_source=crozdesk&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=list"> Contractor Foreman</a> and <a link href="https://crewcost.com/?utm_campaign=25151856-Referral%20Sites&utm_source=The%20Digital%20Project%20Manager"> Crew Cost</a>. <a link href="https://monday.com/lp/project-management?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=dpm&utm_adgroup=best_construction_project_management_software&utm_campaign=ww-multi-prm-work_mgmt">monday.com</a> is an app to collaberate with other workers and help sort out tasks. <a link href="https://contractorforeman.com/?utm_source=crozdesk&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=list"> Contractor Foreman</a> is an app to get training in order to be a good construction contractor, organize bills and estimates. Finally, <a link href="https://crewcost.com/?utm_campaign=25151856-Referral%20Sites&utm_source=The%20Digital%20Project%20Manager"> Crew Cost</a> is an app to manage profits and expenses. Also, it's to manage projects. After I finished researching software, I researched hardware. I found a website called <a link href="https://www.dustyrobotics.com/articles/what-is-construction-technology"> Dusty Robotics </a> that had catagories of technology. The ones I researched were Robotics, 3D Printing, and drones. Robotics helps in excavation, reduces manual labor and lets construction workers focus on less physically demanding tasks. 3D Printing decreases costs for materials, decreases building time and makes complex designs. Lastly, drones inspect active and potential sites which is good because if something happened in the site like a giant rock falling on the drone, you can make another one. It is also good for inspections because it can look into places a human cannot because the drone is tinier.</p>

## EDP
<p> Currently, I think I am finished on research for now. I am on the step brainstorming possible solutions. To do this, I will look at all my research and see what solutions I can come up with using that information.</p>

## Skills
<p> Skills that I've gotten better at and learned are time management, skimming and how to search good.</p>

### Time Management
<ul>
   <li> Throughout this week writing blog 2, I have had lots of things I've had to work on. I've had ELA projects, tests and more. So I've learned how to do a little bit of the blog occasionally so when I'm finishing the blog I've already wrote most of it.</li>
   
<h3>Skimming</h3>
  <li> While researching, I noticed how much information every website I used had. It would take me days to read all of it. So, in order to get all the information without wasting time, I learned to focus on important parts of the text and that saved me lots of time. </li> 
<h3> How to Search Good</h3>
   <li> While doing this process, I realized how much hardware websites there were when I typed "Construction Technology". So, I put key words like apps to get software and apps. </li>
</ul>
  


## Next Steps
<p> My next step is to brainstorm new solutions and learn just a little bit more about construction technolgy.</p>
