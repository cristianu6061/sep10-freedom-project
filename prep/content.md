## Part A: existing technology
### Software
* 1st search: "Construction apps"
* I found a website called <a link href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/tools/best-construction-project-management-software/"> DPM</a> that had websites that helped in construction
* The first website ranked was <a link href="https://monday.com/lp/project-management?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=dpm&utm_adgroup=best_construction_project_management_software&utm_campaign=ww-multi-prm-work_mgmt">monday.com</a> 
  * https://monday.com/lp/project-management?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=dpm&utm_adgroup=best_construction_project_management_software&utm_campaign=ww-multi-prm-work_mgmt
  * helps manage simple tasks
  * simple to use
  * free
  * very organized and versitile
  * other options such as collaborating
  
* 2nd website I found on the list was <a link href="https://contractorforeman.com/?utm_source=crozdesk&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=list"> Contractor Foreman</a>

  * paid service
  
  * training service to become a good contractor
  
  * organizes estimates, expenses, bills, etc.
  
  * calander for meetings, calls, incidents, etc.
  
  * has templetes for documents and has custom PDF language feature
  
* 3rd website I looked at was <a link href="https://crewcost.com/?utm_campaign=25151856-Referral%20Sites&utm_source=The%20Digital%20Project%20Manager"> Crew Cost</a>
  * can be used on computer 
  * good for managing projects
  * paid service
  * organizes profits and expenses
  * website strictly for construction so it isn't confusing
### Hardware
* 1st google search: " Construction technology"
* I found a website called <a link href="https://www.dustyrobotics.com/articles/what-is-construction-technology"> Dusty Robotics </a> that had catagories of technology
* One of the catagories was Robotics
  * Robotics helps in demolition, laying materials, and excavation
  * because robotics does all those things, employee safety improves a lot
  * reduces manual labor
  * increases efficiency
  * lets construction workers focus on less physically demanding tasks
* Second catagory I found was 3rd printing
  * decreases costs for materials
  * increases building time
  * makes complex designs
  * makes parts for buildings or furnature
* The 3rd catagory I found was drones
  * drones inspect active and potential sites
  * drones are safer for inspections bc if something were to happen to the drone you can make another one
  * more efficient bc they can look into more smaller spaces that a human cannot
